    "A binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution that measure the number of success of an experiment (having only 2 outputs: success or fail). We assume the experiments are independent. For example, if we consider the example \"obtaining two aces when one draws 5 times\", we should return the card back after each draw. The formulation of the binomial distribution is:\n",

    "$$P(x)=\\binom{n}{x}p^x(1-p)^{n-x}$$\n",

    "The binomial distribution takes two parameters, $n$ and $p$. Therefore, it is often called as $B(n,p)$\n",

    "The mean of a binomial is $\\mu=np$, and variance $\\sigma^2=npq$. When the sample is big enough (usually $n \\geq 30$) the binomial is modeled like a Normal distribution as follows:\n",

    "$$B(n,p)=N(np,\\sqrt{npq})$$\n",

    "\n",
    "The main use of the field of statistics is to estimate parameters of a population by using the statistics of a sample (parameter refers to any value that describes something from the population such as mean, variance etc., while statistic is the value that describes the sample).\n",

    "\n",
    "A sampling distribution is when we take more than one (and independent) random sample of the same size from a given population. \n",
    "\n",
    "With a population with a mean of $\\mu$ and standard deviation of Ïƒ. If we compare this to a sampling distribution obtained by forming simple random samples of size $n$, the sampling distribution of the mean will still have a mean of $\\mu$, but the standard deviation for a sampling distribution becomes $\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}$. [[ThoughtCo]](https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-a-sampling-distribution-3126417)\n",
    "\n",
    "The central limit theorem states that the sampling distribution tends to be a normal distribution (the larger size of the sample $N$ is) with a mean of $\\bar{x}=\\mu$ and standard deviation of $\\sigma_{sample}=\\sigma \\sqrt{n}$. \n",

    "#### Degrees of freedom\n",
    "An estimate of the variance based on a sample size of 100 is based on more information than an estimate of the variance based on a sample size of 5. The degrees of freedom of an estimate is the number of independent pieces of information on which the estimate is based.[[OnlineStatBook]](http://onlinestatbook.com/2/estimation/df.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "If we sample two elements (independently!) to compute the mean, this estimate has two degrees of freedom because we used two independent pieces of information. However, if we compute the variance the they will not be completely independent anymore: in order to compute the variance it is necessary to compute the mean first. When computing the mean, the elements influence each other (if we had sampled another elements, the mean would be different)\n",
    "\n",
    "The degrees of freedom for an estimate is equal to the number of values minus the number of parameters estimated for computing it. Therefore the estimate of variance has $2-1=1$ degree of freedom (2 pieces of information minus 1 parameter estimated, the mean, for the computation of the variance).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bias\n",
    "Bias: A statistic is biased if, on average, of the statistic of the sample is different from the parameter (of the population). The mean of a sample is an unbiased estimate because there is no tendency for overestimate/underestimate.In the case of estimating variance it is computed as $s^2=\\frac{\\sum (x-\\bar{x}) }{N-1}$ where $(N-1)$ is the degrees of freedom.\n",
